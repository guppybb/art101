            <h1>Lab 3: Who is Gabby?</h1>
                <p>My name is Gabby Botto and this is my homepage and introduction! I am currently 19, about to turn 20 and this is my first programming class. All of this is very new to me but it is fun to learn. I hope to use these skills even outside this class. I love music and movies and just recently watched The Truman Show for the first time! That is a little bit about me. </p>
            <h3>Subject</h3>
                <p>The subject of this lab is learning how to transfer files and understanding how file structures function.</p>
            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                <p>Similarly to the last lab, I had difficulties linking my image file to my HTML file correctly in order for it to appear on my website.</p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>The results of this lab are the skills to navigate files and how to transfer them as well as an organized website.</p>
