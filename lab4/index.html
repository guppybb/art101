			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>One challenge we had was creating the pseudocode in lab.js. We are both new to coding and programming so navigating everything was a little challenging.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Only problem was that we realized we did task 1 wrong but thankfully caught it early on. We accidentally typed the pseudocode in the google doc rather than in the actual file on VScode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We learned how to pseudocode simple and more complex tasks in VScode. We also learned some good ways for creating games and the ways that games function.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>

						Task 1 - Baking Bread from Scratch
						1. Get out all necessary ingredient and supplies: instant active yeast, flour, warm water, salt, one bowl, measuring cup, cling wrap, spatula, parchment paper, and baking pan
						2. With the spatula, mix together 3 cups of flour, 2 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of instant active yeast, and 1.5 cups of very warm (but not hot) water in the large bowl
						3. After mixing, cover the dough with the cling wrap and let it sit in a warm place of about 77-86℉ for 2 hours (120 minutes)
						4. 30 minutes before the dough is done sitting in its warm place, preheat the oven to 450℉
						5. Once the oven is preheated, place the empty baking pan in the oven until the rising time is complete for the dough
						6. After the 2 hours is up, sprinkle some extra flour onto a dry countertop or cutting board
						7. Scrape the dough out onto the floured surface
						8. Clean of your spatula and roughly fold the dough over itself, about three or four times
						9. Place the dough onto a piece of parchment paper
						10. Remove the now hot baking pan from the oven carefully and put the dough with the parchment paper in the center of the pan
						11. Carefully put the pan back in the oven again
						12. Leave the pan with the bread in the oven at 450℉ for about 30 minutes, or until it is crispy and brown on the outside
						13. Carefully remove the pan from the oven after 30 minutes have passed
						14. Leave the bread to cool for about 10 minutes
						15. Slice a piece off
						16. Enjoy!
